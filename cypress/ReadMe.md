1. For Automation tests I've used Cypress Framework (v 10.8.0).
(fyi, I've never used Automation at work, the only source of how to use it is Udemy course; although I really enjoyed working with Cypress & Automation and want to learn more!)
2. My tests are located in this file: qa-interview-dashboard/cypress/e2e/dashboardTests_spec.js
3. Video of test run is included in videos folder: qa-interview-dashboard/cypress/videos/dashboardTests_spec.js.mp4
